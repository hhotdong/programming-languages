- Why is it called 'vector'?
  <details><summary>Stack overflow answer</summary>
    
    > It's called a vector because Alex Stepanov, the designer of the Standard Template Library, was looking for a name to distinguish it from built-in arrays.
    > He admits now that he made a mistake, because mathematics already uses the term 'vector' for a fixed-length sequence of numbers.
    > C++11 compounds this mistake by introducing a class 'array' that behaves similarly to a mathematical vector.
